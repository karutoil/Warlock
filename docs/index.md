# Warlock Game Server Manager

Warlock is a web-based dedicated game server manager for Linux servers for a variety of games.
It is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.

To maximize performance, it attempts to use native tools and libraries where possible,
so no Docker containers are required.

For games which do not natively support Linux servers, Valve's or Glorious Eggroll's Proton is used.
