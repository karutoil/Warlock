# Warlock - Remote Server Management System

In this repo prefer grouped declarations:
- Group related `const`/`let` at the top of the function/block scope.
- Use a single `const` declaration with comma-separated identifiers when appropriate.
- Avoid scattering small `const`/`let` statements across the body.
  (Used by humans, linters and Copilot prompts.)

## Architecture Overview
Warlock is an Express.js web application that provides remote management for game servers via SSH. 
The system consists of a Node.js backend (`app.js`) serving static HTML files with embedded 
JavaScript frontends that communicate with remote Linux servers.

Since this system is designed for package installing and system management,
all operations are performed with root privileges via SSH commands.

## Key Components

### Backend Structure (`app.js`)
- **Express Server**: Runs on port 3077 (configurable via `PORT` env var)
- **SSH Command Execution**: All server operations use SSH to execute commands on remote server
- **Real-time Monitoring**: System stats fetched via custom SSH commands to remote server

### Frontend Architecture (`public/`)
- **Self-contained HTML files**: Each page has embedded CSS and JavaScript
- **Real-time Updates**: Uses `setInterval` for periodic API calls (3-second intervals)
- **Terminal-style UI**: Cyberpunk aesthetic with blue/teal color scheme
- **API Communication**: Fetch-based requests to backend endpoints

## Critical API Endpoints

### Game Server Management
- `POST /create-server`: Create new game server instances
- `POST /server-control`: Start/stop/restart servers (requires `server_id` and `action`)
- `POST /server-config`: Modify server configurations
- `POST /player-management`: Handle player operations
- `POST /backup-restore`: Server backup and restore operations

### File Management
- `POST /browse-files`: Directory listing with path navigation
- `POST /view-file`: File content viewing
- `POST /create-folder`: Directory creation
- File upload via multer middleware

## Development Workflow

### Running the Application
```bash
npm run dev    # Development with nodemon
npm start      # Production
```

### Key Dependencies
- **express**: Web framework
- **multer**: File upload handling
- **nodemon**: Development auto-restart

### Remote Server Dependencies
The remote server must have:
- SSH access configured for root user
- `/home/steam/VEIN/manage.py` script for game server management
- Standard Unix utilities (ps, df, free, top, etc.) for system monitoring

## Project-Specific Patterns

### SSH Command Structure
All remote operations follow this pattern:
```javascript
const command = `ssh root@45.26.230.248 'command_here'`;
exec(command, callback);
```

### Error Handling Convention
API responses use consistent structure:
```javascript
{ success: boolean, error?: string, data?: any }
```

### Frontend Update Pattern
Real-time components follow this pattern:
```javascript
async function fetchData() { /* API call */ }
setInterval(fetchData, 3000);  // 3-second updates
```

### CSS Architecture
- Embedded styles in each HTML file
- Consistent color scheme: `#0096ff` (primary blue), `#1a1a2e` (dark background)
- Orbitron font for headers, Rajdhani for body text
- Grid layouts with responsive cards

## Integration Points

### Remote Server Communication
- **SSH Key Authentication**: Assumes passwordless SSH to root@45.26.230.248
- **Game Management Script**: `/home/steam/VEIN/manage.py` handles all server lifecycle
- **System Monitoring**: Custom shell commands for real-time stats collection

### File System Operations
- Upload directory: Server handles file storage location
- File browsing: Recursive directory navigation via SSH commands
- File viewing: Direct file content retrieval via SSH

## Common Operations

### Adding New API Endpoints
1. Define command in `commandConfigs` object if SSH-based
2. Use `createCommandEndpoint(commandName)` for standard SSH operations
3. Add manual endpoint for custom logic requiring special handling

### Adding New Frontend Pages
1. Create HTML file in `public/` directory
2. Add route in `app.js`: `app.get('/page', (req, res) => res.sendFile(...))`
3. Follow established CSS/JS patterns for consistency
4. Add navigation link in existing pages' header menu

### Debugging Remote Operations
- SSH commands logged to console during execution
- Monitor terminal output in browser for real-time feedback
- Check remote server logs: `/home/steam/VEIN/logs/` (if applicable)
