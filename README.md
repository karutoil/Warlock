## AI / LLM Disclaimer

Warlock was originally generated with various models including GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5
via Copilot's integration feature.

Then it was effectively rewritten because generated code is absolutely rubbish and horribly unmaintainable.

After wasting a week just un-fraking the generated code, now we just use those AI models to generate tiny snippets of code throughout this project.
